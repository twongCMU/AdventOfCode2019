# AdventOfCode2019

This was my first Advent of Code. I found out about it on Dec 17 and was also on vacation a few days before the 25th so I had to jam a lot of solutions in a short time:

I was only able to collect 44 of the 50 stars. I'm writing this a year after but I remember being bad at doing maze searching puzzles. It was super fun that some of the puzzles built on the previous solutions and we were slowly implementing a primitive computer instruction set, then one of the inputs was a program that did Arkanoid. We were tasked with finding the score after all of the bricks were broken and I solved it by implementing an AI to play the game. That was so fun.
